<p>Next we are going to calculate sleep apnea costs to all countries. Method to estimate sleep apnea cost is applied from the article <a href="https://cergas.unibocconi.eu/sites/default/files/files/Cost-of-illness-study-of-Obstructive-Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome-%2528OSAS%2529-in-Italy_Report%25281%2529.pdf">Ameni et al. (2019) <em>Cost-of-illness study of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in Italy</em></a>.</p>
<p>Firstly open a database connection. We need two datasets OSA dataset <code>slapnea</code> for calculating population absolute values and <code>prevalences</code> dataset which we created in last chapter.</p>
